# oneconversation

https://vanillaforums.org/addon/oneconversation-plugin

This plugin allows only one conversation between two users:

* The "Message" button redirects to the latest conversation with that user. (configurable)
* Newly started conversation messages are automatically added to the latest conversation. (configurable)

This makes Vanilla conversations more like Facebook chats or WhatsApp messages.

Group conversations are not affected by this.
